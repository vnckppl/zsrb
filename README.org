* Standardized (z-transformed) Regression Based Change Scores
This R package allows you to calculate Standardized (z-transformed) Regression Based ('ZSRB') change scores. Such scores permit evaluation of meaningful changes in test scores over time, while accounting for testâ€“retest reliability, practice effects, score fluctuations due to error, and relevant clinical and demographic factors.

Calculating ZSRB scores requires a control group that serves as the baseline population for estimating 'normal' expected change, and one or more other groups.
